Numbers do not end but we will only use 4 digit number problems. The same idea can be used to get the sum of bigger numbers.",
                        "Numbers with more than one digit are added column by column from right to left and when a sum of a column is bigger than 9, the ONES PLACE digit is the sum for that column and the TENS PLACE DIGIT is a carry digit to the next column to be added with that columns numbers. This represents that the sum of the numbers added is larger than 9 and the CARRY digit is placed in the next column to show that the next highest place value has increased by 1.   "
